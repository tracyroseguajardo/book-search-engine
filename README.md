## Description
This application is a responsive and handy tool which allows a user to search for books and logged in users may save and delete books to a list stored in their profile.

This application is powered by an Apollo Server which uses GraphQL to fetch and modify data. GraphQL has just one endpoint which is manipulated throught mutations and queries. This enables us to avoid the use of routes and controllers to call multiple possible endpoints.

## Installation

If you wish to work with this application's raw code you must first clone this repository. From here you will have capabilities to work on the front end as well as the back end. Don't forget to install your dependencies in the root, the server, and the client folders. You can do this individually or npm install will work through each one in succession with just the one command. Look to the scripts in the root package.json in order to target the area(s) where you want to work and to properly get the chosen side(s) running with the correct call. The graphQL server runs on localhost 3001 while the development server runs on localhost 3000.
